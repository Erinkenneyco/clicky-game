#The Muppet Clicky Game


##Overview
The Muppet Clicky Game is a web game application where users click images of the amazing Muppets in order to earn points. You win the game whenever you have clicked all 9 of the Muppets. The only catch is that the Muppets move in their location with every click...

##Technologies Used:

React.js- UI

###Getting Started
First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app clicky-game-app in the command line. Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd clicky-game-app' in the terminal. After that I typed yarn start to open the app in the browser.

Starting to Code
Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files.  The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory.
